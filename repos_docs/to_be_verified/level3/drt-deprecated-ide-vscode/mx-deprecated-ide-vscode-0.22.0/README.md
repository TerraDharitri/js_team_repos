DharitrI IDE was an extension for Visual Studio Code that offered development support for DharitrI Smart Contracts written in Rust.

**Instead, developers are recommended to directly use [`sc-meta`](https://docs.dharitri.org/developers/meta/sc-meta-cli)** - tool of the [**SpaceCraft**](https://github.com/TerraDharitri/drt-rs-sdk) Rust framework - in order to build and test smart contracts.

Additionally, for writing and debugging Smart Contracts written in Rust, the following extensions are recommended:

 - [Rust Analyzer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer)
 - [CodeLLDB](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vadimcn.vscode-lldb)
