# drt-js-sdk-hw-provider

Signing provider for dApps: hardware wallet (Ledger).

Documentation is available on [docs.dharitri.org](https://docs.dharitri.org/sdk-and-tools/drtjs/drtjs-signing-providers/), while an integration example can be found [here](https://github.com/terradharitri/drt-js-sdk-examples/tree/main/signing-providers).

Note that **we recommend using [dapp-core](https://github.com/terradharitri/drt-sdk-dapp)** instead of integrating the signing provider on your own.
